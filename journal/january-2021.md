I spend an awful lot of time to troubleshoot the external access for my ipv6 server(s). Well I learned alot on the way so thats a plus. In the end I decided to change my ISP which offers real DS and a global IPv4. Again this not the fix for IPv6 servers as they should work in DS lite already, but I'm just done sitting behind an AFTR-Gateway and using my current router. I joined linked in aswell and was positively surprised about the blog posts. I already spent some time to go done different rabbit holes.

So now that I own a cluster in my sub system It's time to decide what to do whith it. Obiously I'm going to play around with vulkan sdk on windows now :D. The original plan was to spin up a small server and integrate with Keycloak and Certbot. But I'm a bit demotivated with backend stuff after the DS lite mess. Also I couldn't have a real end to end test for my certificates anyway :(. Plus I watched the PoE 3.1.3 expansion announcement, in which vulkan support was announced. This could get messy as it's a very low level API with full control over GPU.
